<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>The two languages—HTML and CSS—are independent of one another and should remain that way. CSS should not be written
    inside of an HTML document and vice versa. As a rule, HTML will always represent content, and CSS will always
    represent the appearance of that content.</p>

<h2>Elements</h2>
<p>Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. Some of the more frequently
    used elements include multiple levels of headings (identified as &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; elements) and
    paragraphs (identified as the
    &lt;p&gt; element); the list goes on to include the &lt;a&gt;,
    &lt;div&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;em&gt; elements, and many more.</p>
<p>Elements are identified by the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets, < >, surrounding the element name.

<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a tag. Tags most
    commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attributes include
    the id attribute, which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies an element; the src attribute,
    which specifies a source for embeddable content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a
    linked resource.</p>
